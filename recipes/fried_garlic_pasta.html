        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound angel hair pasta</li>
            <li>2 cups olive oil for frying</li>
            <li>2 bulbs garlic, peeled and diced</li>
            <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat until a piece of garlic dropped into oil gently sizzles. Add remaining garlic; cook and stir until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove fried garlic to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon and set aside; reserve garlic-infused olive oil.</li>
            <li>Place angel hair onto individual serving dishes and sprinkle with fried garlic. Drizzle with some of the garlic-infused olive oil and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Reserve any remaining garlic-infused olive oil for another use.</li>
        </ol>
