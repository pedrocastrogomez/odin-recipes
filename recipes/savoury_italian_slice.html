        Fluffy, creamy, sweet 'n salty!
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>100 g kale chopped</li>
            <li>140 g roasted red capsicums (from a jar) chopped(can also use pre-cooked mushrooms, bell pepper, zucchini, tomatoes, etc)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sliced spring onions(or normal pre-fried onion)</li>
            <li>8 eggs well beaten</li>
            <li>100 g feta crumbled</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Use a non-stick pan (preferably one with a lid) or a pot with a heavy bottom.</li>
            <li>Grease the pan lightly with oil or line the base with baking paper if you can (optional but helps with sticking).</li>
            <li>Layer the kale on the bottom.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped capsicum and spring onions on top.</li>
            <li>Pour the beaten eggs evenly over the vegetables.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper, and sprinkle with crumbled feta.</li>
            <li>Cover the pan with a lid (very important to trap the heat like a mini-oven).</li>
            <li>Cook over very low heat for about 15–25 minutes, depending on the thickness of the mixture. Keep the heat as low as possible to avoid burning the bottom before the eggs are cooked through.</li>
            <li>Check it by inserting a knife in the center — it should come out clean when it’s ready.</li>
            <li>Optional: If you want a lightly browned top, you can carefully flip it after it’s mostly set (or just leave it as is).</li>
        </ol>
